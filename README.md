# A JavaMail Feedback Forum

This javaMail demo was created in 2001 for learning/tutorial purposes and has served as the basis for many projects in my career.

It was recently retrieved from Geocities.com, one of the most popular and successful free personal web hosting services of the 1990s, which was shut down in October 2009.

Apparently all sites hosted on the service would be deleted and could not be recovered.

Thanks to Geocities for not deleting this and many of my other projects.


## Objective:

Demonstrates how to work with Javamail. This example shows how to get information from the web form and send it through email.
